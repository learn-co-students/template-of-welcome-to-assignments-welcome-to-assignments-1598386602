# Hello, Assessments!

Testing, testing...

This assessment won't be graded. It's just here to give you a chance to try out our assessments feature.

While you're here, take the time to read about our Assessment Philosophy and Assessment Validity.

## Flatiron Assessment Philosophy

Assessments let you demonstrate what you've learned. This is important for a few reasons:

1. Gives you feedback on your progress

If you've mastered a skill, assessments should tell you so you can move on confidently. If you still need more practice, assessments can point you towards what you need to work on.

2. Gives instructors a sense of your progress

Your teachers need to know what you know. That way, they can move on to the next topics if you are ready, or spend more time on what you need help with. Teachers need to know the progress of both individual students as well as the whole class. Our assessments are designed to give teachers the info they need to adjust what and how they teach.

3. Informs the determination of your progression

You may need more time with the material in order to master it. Assessments are one source of data that instructors and managers can use to determine how you progress through the program. This will work differently depending on the program - you should hear more about it in your orientation.

4. Provides feedback for the curriculum

The curriculum you see has been developed over years of iteration and testing. One important source of input into our curriculum is our measurement of how well students are learning. While you might not see the impact of your assessments on the curriculum immediately, assessments have a huge cumulative effect over time.

5. Gives confidence to employers

Employers trust that Flatiron graduates are able to consistently perform at a given level. That's one of the reasons we're able to maintain the job placement rate and job guarantee that we do. While employers don't know the details of our assessments, having the assessments in place allows us to consistently promise that Flatiron grads will be successful on the job. 


## Assessment Validity

'Assessment Validity' means that everyone can trust the assessment. In particular, good assessments should limit _false positives_ and _false negatives_. That means that assessments need to be challenging enough to actually measure what you know, but not so hard (or unclear) that you get a low score despite knowing the right answer.

No assessment is perfect. Sometimes you'll have an off day, or (despite all our efforts) the instructions won't be clear.  Recognizing that all assessments are imperfect, we take a few different measures to help ensure that they are fair and consistent.

## Expectations for Flatiron

To make assessments fair for you, we aim to meet certain expectations for our assessments and assessment process. Assessments should have *clear instructions*, *transparent rubrics*, *assistance with the process*, and *multiple opportunities*. 

### Clear instructions

We want to assess your learning progress - not how well you can interpret our instructions. We aim to write instructions that are clear and unambiguous.

We aim to construct assessments with authentic tasks. We won't always be perfect in this - sometimes assessing a piece of understanding will mean we have to write tasks that don't match up to the real world. 

### Assistance with the process

You are encouraged to ask your instructors questions about the assessment process, requirements, and to help debug environment issues. 

Instructors won't solve the assessment for you, but they can help ensure you don't get stuck on an environment issue.

### Transparent Rubrics

The rubrics we use to review and score assessments should be objective and transparent. When we can, we'll share the rubric with you ahead of time, so you know what we'll be looking for on the assessment.

### Multiple Opportunities

If you do not do well on an assessment, you'll have other opportunities to demonstrate your learning. Depending on the situation, that might mean:

- Taking another assessment
- Having an live interview with an instructor
- Conducting a project review

Logistically, we will not be able to offer indefinite retaking of assessments or self-selecting what mode of assessment you will take.

## Rules for you

To make assessments fair for Flatiron, we also ask you to follow some rules when taking assessments. It boils down to 
*don't borrow answers* and *don't share answers*.

### Don't borrow answers

You are allowed to use the internet to reference documentation. We want the assessments to be authentic to real world tasks - you will be able to search for language documentation in the real world. 

You are not allowed to search for the exact answers to the challenge. Similarly, don't get the answers from another student. If you are copying and pasting solutions, you aren't actually measuring what you know. That limits everyone's ability to tell how your learning is going.

You are also not allowed to reference old labs, code, and notes, even if they're your own. We want to know how much you've retained from what we've covered so far - if you are using your old code, it's not clear what you've retained.

### Don't share answers

You are not allowed to share the assessment or your solution. That means that you shouldn't sending it directly to someone or post it publicly online. Sharing the assessment or solution makes it harder for future students to get a fair chance at feedback.
